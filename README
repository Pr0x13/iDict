Put in HtDocs Folder in your Xampp installation.

Wordlist.txt is from iBrute and it satisfies iCloud password Requirements
It's been reported if icloud server responds with an error restart xampp or your computer

-=Reports coming in that Server is now Patched with Rate Limiter=-


What is this?
A 100% Working iCloud Apple ID Dictionary attack that bypasses 
Account Lockout restrictions and Secondary Authentication on any account.


                                                                      

What this isn't:
A bypass or fully automated removal




Why? 
This bug is painfully obvious and was only a matter of time before it was 
privately used for malicious or nefarious activities, I publicly disclosed it so apple will patch it.
